# PageScroll Re-Enabler
## Summary
PageScroll Re-Enabler is a chrome extension that tries to re-enable the possibility to scroll by mouse-wheel on websites, where this is not possible.
## Description
Do you know these websites, where scrolling by mouse-wheel etc. isn't possible and you always have to drag the f*ckin scrollbar manually?
This extension deals with this annoying problem and makes them comfortably scrollable again!
## Problematic Websites
Websites where I know this problem exists:
[starwars.ea.com](http://starwars.ea.com/)
## Easy enabling/disabling
The Extension can easily be disabled (e.g. when you're having problems with it) by a switch in the icon popup window (and easily be re-enabled again of course).

# Prerequisites
- You have to have the Chrome browser (or alternatives like Chromium) installed of course
- Chrome **must** be at least version 22 (but I hope for the sake of the internet that your browser is a hell of a lot more up-to-date)
